# PSYCHE

The **central dogma of molecular biology** is an explanation of the flow of genetic information within a biological system: 
```
Transcription (DNA to RNA) -> (RNA Processing) -> Translation (RNA to Protein) -> Protein Folding
```

The coding region of a gene, also known as the **coding sequence (CDS)**, is the portion of a gene's DNA or RNA that codes for protein.

Proteinogenic amino acids are amino acids that are incorporated biosynthetically into proteins during translation. The word *proteinogenic* means *protein creating*.


### Concepts

- **Proteins** vs. **Peptides**: Both peptides and proteins are polymers of amino acids, and they are linked together by peptide bonds.
    - Peptides: 
        - Small chains of amino acids that are not long enough to be considered a full protein.         
        - Often act as signaling molecules in the body, such as neurotransmitters or hormones.
        - Peptides: Insulin, oxytocin, and many of the body's neurotransmitters.
    - Proteins: 
        - Longer chains of amino acids. A molecule with more than about 50 amino acids would usually be considered a protein (no strict cutoff). Proteins can be made up of a single polypeptide chain or multiple polypeptide chains.
        - Wide variety of functions in the body, including acting as enzymes, providing structural support, transporting molecules, etc.
